# PongGame
A simple game of Pong for two players.
For this game, I created the following classes:
  - Paddle class - in order to create and control the paddle;
  - Ball class - in order to create the ball, make it move and make it bounce from walls/paddles;
  - Scoreboard Class - in order to keep and update the score.
